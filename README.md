# 🔥 Hestia: Predict, Prevent, Protect

## Overview

**ForestFire AI** is an intelligent forest fire prevention and management system that predicts the behavior of forest fires using synthetic or historical data.  
It provides real-time risk heatmaps, predicts the direction and speed of fire spread, and generates dynamic evacuation plans using Google Maps overlays.

This system is designed to help authorities, emergency services, and communities **act faster, smarter, and safer** during wildfire events.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Predictive Fire Spread Modeling**  
  Analyze terrain, weather, and vegetation to predict fire movement over time.

- **Dynamic Risk Heatmaps**  
  Overlay fire risk zones (Green → Yellow → Red) on Google Maps for intuitive monitoring.

- **Evacuation Plan Generator**  
  Automatically identify safe zones and suggest optimized evacuation routes.

- **Incident Command Dashboard**  
  A clean, actionable dashboard showing current fire spread, risk levels, and evacuation strategies.

- **Scenario Simulation**  
  Test "What-If" fire scenarios by adjusting parameters like wind speed and humidity.

- **Scalable Design**  
  Ready to integrate real-time drone or satellite data for live deployments.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Data Input**  
   - Synthetic or historical fire data
   - Terrain maps
   - Weather parameters (wind, humidity, temperature)

2. **Fire Spread Prediction**  
   Lightweight ML models or heuristics predict the likely path and speed of fire over time.

3. **Heatmap Generation**  
   Risk zones are dynamically calculated and overlaid on a live Google Map.

4. **Evacuation Planning**  
   Safe exits are calculated and routes updated in real-time based on predicted fire paths.

5. **Dashboard Output**  
   All insights are presented in a simple, clean, actionable web dashboard.

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

- **No real-time sensor data**: Currently working with past/simulated data only.
- **Simplified fire models**: Advanced physics simulation is not implemented at MVP stage.
- **API Quotas**: Google Maps API quotas could limit heavy usage.

---

## 🔥 Future Scope

- Integrate **real drone sensors** or **NASA FIRMS** real-time fire alerts.
- Add **wildlife evacuation modules** to protect endangered species.
- Partner with **government agencies** or **environmental NGOs**.
- Improve spread prediction models using **deep learning**.
